    <p>Phinks is an Enhancer-type Nen user. He is the second-strongest in the Troupe physically. Brazen, rash, and ruthless, he is a punch-first ask-questions-later type of individual. In comparison to the rest of the Troupe, he has a much simpler nature. He has sworn eternal fealty to Chrollo and eternal revenge against
      Hisoka and Kurapika. I have recieved intel on his Hatsu from members of Meteor City; his power is nearly infinite if allowed to charge. When he winds his arm, he exponentially increases the power of his next punch. Honestly, he may be one of the most dangerous members to face one-on-one.
