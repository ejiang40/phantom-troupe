    <p>Hisoka is an ex-Phantom Troupe member. It is unknown which member he killed and replaced to join the Troupe in the first place. Unlike every other member of the Troupe, Hisoka has no devotion to the Spider. In fact, he is completely self-centered. He lives only to fight strong enemies. 
    He joined in order to challenge Chrollo Lucilfer, whom he regards as one of the strongest nen users in the world. Currently, he is on the Blue Whale seeking to kill the rest of the Troupe. His nen aura has the properties of rubber and gum and can be used in many different ways.</p>
