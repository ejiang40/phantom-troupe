    <p>Shalnark is a Manipulator-type Nen user who uses his phone to control other people's wills. He has the most cheerful demeanor of all the Troupe and is very levelheaded. However, some believe that this cheerful demeanor hides a dark and sadistic code, given the fact that he is still a member of the Spiders and 
    still a part of the numerous atrocities they committed. His last resort is his "Autopilot Mode", in which he uses his phone to control himself, gaining immense strength. He has been missing for some time, reported right after the death of Hisoka at Heavens Arena.</p>
