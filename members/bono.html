    <p>Bonolenov is a Conjurer-type Nen user who uses holes in his bodies to create crippling soundwaves. His fighting style descends from his tribe and resembles a spiritual dance. Very little about Bonolenov's personality and reasons for joining the Troupe is known. However, he displays fealty to Chrollo and 
    friendship with the rest of the Troupe.</p>
