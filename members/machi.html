    <p>Machi is a Transmuter-type Nen user. She is a master fighter and healer. In particular, her nen threads and flesh-healing abilities provide the entire Troupe with the best recovery tools and options. She also has incredible intuition and an unparalleled dedication to the Spider. Shalnark claims that Machi is a nice
      person at heart, but she participated as the rest of the Troupe did in the Massacre of the Kurta Clan. Despite her petite appearance, she is quite physically strong and has both Enhancement and Transmuter proficiencies. Approach with extreme caution and do not allow her appearances to decieve you.
