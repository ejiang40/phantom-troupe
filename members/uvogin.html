    <p>Uvogin was an Enhancer-type Nen user. He was physically the strongest of the Phantom Troupe. After participating in the massacre of the Kurta Clan, Uvogin went missing until the Yorknew City auction. There, he was challenged by Kurapika, and after a hardfought battle, died to Kurapika's awakening Nen.
    This set off a streak of havoc across all of Yorknew. The remaining Spiders lost all inhibitions in their killing spree as tribute and "requiem" to Uvogin. Ultimately, his death marked a new era in the Phantom Troupe.</p>
