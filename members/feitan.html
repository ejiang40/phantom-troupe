    <p>Feitan is a Transmuter-type Nen user. He is among the Troupe's strongest members, and almost never takes fights seriously as a result. He speaks in a cold, strange grammar. He seems to prioritize the Spider as a whole over individual members, being willing to sacrifice Chrollo in order to get revenge against
      Kurapika, who killed Uvogin in Yorknew. Although he has Enhancement-level strength and speed, I believe his true power lies in his transmutation Hatsu. When the Phantom Troupe defended Meteor City from the threat of the NGL Chimera Ants, numerous witnesses reported seeing a minature sun over Zazan's nest. In all
      honesty, Feitan scares me more than the other Phantom Troupe Members. It's not just that he's sadistic - it's the creepy foreboding feeling that his true strength has yet to be seen.
