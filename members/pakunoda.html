    <p>Pakunoda is a Specialist-type Nen user. She has one of the most unique and dangerous nen abilities ever. She can touch someone and access all their memories. She can even search out memories pertaining to a certain person or thing. In Yorknew, she used her ability to defy Kurapika's Judgement Chain, killing herself
      and giving the rest of the founding Troupe members her memories relating to Kurapika so that they might get revenge for Uvogin.
