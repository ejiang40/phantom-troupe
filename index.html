    <p><strong>Welcoming all hunters to the site of the Phantom Troupe...</strong></p>

    <p>This website serves as a living investigation of the Phantom Troupe, also known as "The Spiders". It contains information on their
    crimes and membership.</p>
      
    <p>Any hunter using this website to pursue their bounties should exercise extreme caution. The Phantom Troupe is 
    ruthless and have been known to torture and kill without mercy or discrimination. I myself am a victim of theirs and have dedicated my 
    life to their destruction. Please use the information on this site to bring an end to their reign of terror. I humbly thank you brave 
    and purehearted hunters, and wish you all the luck. When my life's mission has succeeded, I will await you all, dead or living, with 
    a smile as wide as the sun. - TT</p>
